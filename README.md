# library-man-project
 A simple console app, take a look! <br>
 I do this app in around 4 months since I start learning C, although it is a thrown-away PJ anyway, I want to publish my code to show that you can do simple interactions in console.

# Build instruction
 + Step 1: Open the .cbp file in your Code::Blocks IDE
 + Step 2: Choosing your desired config and then 'Build'
 + Step 3: You can go to the newly generated .\bin\Debug (or Release) to add pre-generated books and account to it, or you can run the program directly in C::B IDE

# Note
 I don't have time to rewrite this into a 'make' or 'cmake' project for now
